# Flix4Me
Flix4Me offers the ability to catalogue and rate one's favorite movies in a user-friendly interface. The goal is to eventually make this app the [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com) of movies! Stay tuned for future updates.

## Usage
Follow these steps to run this app locally:
1. Clone it (`git clone https://github.com/mcasciato/Flix4Me`)
2. Have [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed and running
3. Install gems (`bundle install`)
4. Migrate the database (this was made using Rails 5, so the command is `rails db:migrate`)
5. Run `rails bower:install` to install front-end assets (Angular, Bootstrap, etc.)
