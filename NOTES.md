# To do:
1.  Build out a comments feature in the show page for each movie so that users can add many comments to a single movie.
    - new table `comments`, with `:content` and `:movie_id`
2. Build out the favorites feature to be able to save to the Rails Back End
    - `:favorites` - new table or column in `movies`...?
